# Why Reth?

Reth is more than just another Ethereum client—it's the foundation upon which the next generation of blockchain infrastructure is being built. From powering production staking environments at institutions like Coinbase to enabling cutting-edge L2 sequencers and ZK applications, Reth represents the convergence of security, performance, and extensibility that the ecosystem demands.

Every piece of crypto infrastructure will be touching Reth one way or another. Here's why the world's leading developers and institutions are choosing Reth as their node of choice.

## Production-Grade Security

**Battle-tested in the most demanding environments**

Reth isn't just theoretical—it's securing real value on Ethereum mainnet today. When Coinbase chose Reth for their production staking infrastructure, they validated what we've always known: Reth delivers institutional-grade security when it matters most.

-   **Ethereum L1 Production**: Powers staking environments securing billions in ETH
-   **Institutional Trust**: Trusted by Coinbase and other leading institutions for production staking
-   **Battle-Tested**: Proven reliability in high-stakes production environments
-   **Skin in the Game**: We stake our reputation on every block validated

Security isn't just a feature—it's our foundation. When your infrastructure is securing real assets on Ethereum mainnet, you can't afford anything less than absolute reliability.

## Future Proof Performance

**Built for the multi-chain, high-throughput future**

Reth pushes the performance frontier across every dimension that matters. From L2 sequencers processing thousands of transactions per second to MEV block building requiring microsecond precision, Reth delivers the performance that next-generation applications demand.

-   **L2 Sequencer Performance**: Powers production L2 environments including OP Stack chains
-   **MEV & Block Building**: Microsecond-precision performance for competitive block building
-   **Terragas Scale**: Built to handle the massive throughput requirements of tomorrow
-   **Archive-First Design**: First-class support for data-intensive applications and indexing

Performance isn't just about speed—it's about enabling entirely new categories of applications that were previously impossible.

## Infinitely Customizable

**Your blockchain, your rules**

Reth's modular architecture means you're not locked into someone else's design decisions. Build exactly the chain you need, with exactly the features you want, using the same battle-tested foundation that powers Ethereum mainnet.

-   **EVM-First**: Best-in-class support for the world's most widely adopted blockchain VM
-   **Custom Everything**: Customize transaction types, ordering rules, precompiles, and execution logic
-   **Reth SDK**: Build custom L1s and L2s with just a few lines of code
-   **Non-EVM Support**: Extend beyond EVM with custom runtimes and execution environments

The same code securing Ethereum L1 can power your custom chain. Same security guarantees, unlimited flexibility.

## ZK-Native Architecture

**Built for the zero-knowledge future**

The future of blockchain scalability is zero-knowledge proofs, and Reth is designed from the ground up to excel in this paradigm. Our stateless execution model and modular architecture make Reth the ideal foundation for ZK applications.

-   **ZKVM Integration**: Native support for SP1, RISC Zero, and other leading ZKVMs
-   **Stateless Execution**: Optimized for ZK proof generation with stateless MPT execution
-   **Real-World ZK**: Powers production ZK applications today, not just demos
-   **Type-1 zkEVM**: Enable full Ethereum compatibility in zero-knowledge environments

Reth's state transition on large chainstates like Ethereum and Base represents the gold standard for real-world zero-knowledge proof performance.

## Thriving Open Source Ecosystem

**500+ contributors building the future together**

The most important factor in Reth's success is our vibrant open source community. Over 500 geo-distributed developers have contributed to Reth, creating a trained, experienced community that's bought into the long-term vision.

-   **500+ Contributors**: A global community of expert developers
-   **Enterprise Adoption**: Trusted by leading institutions and infrastructure providers
-   **Active Development**: Continuous innovation driven by real-world needs
-   **Ecosystem Integration**: Deep integration across the entire Ethereum ecosystem

From individual developers building the next breakthrough application to enterprises deploying mission-critical infrastructure, the Reth community represents the best of open source collaboration.
