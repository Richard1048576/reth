# How to Use Standalone Components

Using Reth components independently of a full node.

## Overview

Reth's modular architecture allows you to use individual components without running a full node. This is useful for specialized applications, analysis tools, or custom integrations.

## Interacting with the Database Directly

### Opening the Database

```rust
// Example database opening will be added here
```

### Reading Block Data

```rust
// Example block data reading will be added here
```

### Reading Transaction Data

```rust
// Example transaction data reading will be added here
```

### Important Caveats

- **Consistency**: Direct database access bypasses consistency guarantees
- **Locking**: Be aware of potential lock conflicts with running nodes
- **Schema Changes**: Database schema may change between versions
- **Performance**: Direct access may impact node performance

## Using the EVM Standalone

Execute transactions without a full node context.

### EVM Setup

```rust
// Example EVM setup will be added here
```

### Transaction Execution

```rust
// Example transaction execution will be added here
```

## Working with the Transaction Pool

Use the transaction pool component independently.

### Pool Setup

```rust
// Example pool setup will be added here
```

### Adding Transactions

```rust
// Example transaction addition will be added here
```

## Network Components

Use networking components for custom p2p applications.

### Network Setup

```rust
// Example network setup will be added here
```

### Custom Protocol Handling

```rust
// Example protocol handling will be added here
```

## Safety Considerations

- Always use appropriate synchronization
- Handle errors gracefully
- Consider resource cleanup
- Test thoroughly with realistic data
- Monitor resource usage

## Use Cases

- Block explorers
- Analytics tools
- Custom indexers
- Testing frameworks
- Research applications
