# Prerequisites and Considerations

What you need to know before building a custom Reth node.

## Prerequisites

### Rust Knowledge
- Understanding of Rust ownership, lifetimes, and async programming
- Familiarity with traits and generics
- Experience with error handling

### Ethereum Understanding
- Knowledge of Ethereum protocol fundamentals
- Understanding of transaction lifecycle
- Familiarity with consensus mechanisms

### Development Environment
- Rust toolchain (latest stable)
- Git for version control
- Sufficient system resources for compilation

## Key Considerations

### Performance Implications
- Custom components may impact node performance
- Consider profiling and benchmarking your modifications
- Memory usage and CPU overhead

### Compatibility
- Ensure compatibility with Ethereum specifications
- Consider impact on network participation
- Maintain interoperability with other clients

### Maintenance
- Plan for ongoing maintenance and updates
- Consider impact of Reth version upgrades
- Testing strategy for custom components

### Security
- Custom code introduces potential security risks
- Follow Rust security best practices
- Regular security audits for production use

## Architecture Decisions

Before starting, consider:

- Which components need customization
- Whether to extend existing types or create new ones
- How to integrate with existing Reth infrastructure
