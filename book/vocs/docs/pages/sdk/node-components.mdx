# Node Components

Understanding the core components that make up a Reth node.

## Overview

A Reth node consists of several key components that work together to provide Ethereum execution layer functionality.

## Core Components

### Network Layer
Handles peer-to-peer communication and block/transaction propagation.

- **Responsibilities**: Peer discovery, block sync, transaction gossip
- **Key traits**: `NetworkPrimitives`, `NetworkTypes`

### Transaction Pool
Manages pending transactions before they are included in blocks.

- **Responsibilities**: Transaction validation, fee estimation, mempool management
- **Key traits**: `TransactionPool`, `PoolTransaction`

### Consensus Engine
Handles consensus-related operations and block validation.

- **Responsibilities**: Block validation, fork choice, consensus rule enforcement
- **Key traits**: `Consensus`, `HeaderValidator`

### EVM (Execution Engine)
Executes transactions and maintains state.

- **Responsibilities**: Transaction execution, state management, gas calculation
- **Key traits**: `ConfigureEvm`, `EvmConfig`

### RPC Server
Provides JSON-RPC API endpoints for external interaction.

- **Responsibilities**: API endpoints, request handling, response formatting
- **Key traits**: `RpcAddOns`, `EthApiTypes`
